# ZeldaFF-Links-Nightmare
This is a project that I made in 2014 for a school project. I combined my love for Zelda & FF and came up with a very simple game. Just a note before I explain the concept, this application can only run on Windows Visual Studio 2008 and can only be deployed onto one of those old Windows Palm Pilots.

The game is essentially a zelda and final fantasy mash up. The user plays as Link and must move around the map collecting gear and fighting enemies (at random). Fighting enemies levels up the player which in turn unlocks higher level gear which is obtained by walking around the map. Defeated enemies drop keys and after three keys are collected the end boss appears. After the end boss is defeated the game is over.

The game incoporates the following C# practices:
- File I/O
- Abstract Class
- Delegate 
- Event

You can see screenshots of the game in the word document that is attached to this repo. The document outlines a lot of the code and is basically a manual on the game.

My goal, at some point in the future, is to expand on this a bring it to all modern mobile devices.

I hope you have fun with the code and feel free to provide feedback!
